~Last Monday+
 ^
Dear Diary,+
 ^ 
I tried to talk to Tammy today but she didn’t pay me any attention so I pushed her in the fountain… that will show her!+
 ^
I feel like I had a great day today. I stuck some gum on Carl’s eye lid so he couldn’t figure out why he couldn’t shut his eyes. It was hilarious!+
 ^
I really liked watching him struggle I think he deserved it. Jack thinks he is cooler than me but yeah right, I am way cooler than that loser>

~Yesterday+
 ^
Dear Diary,+
 ^ 
I am missing some things around my house… I think Slade is up so something but I can’t catch her in the act.+
 ^
I saw Luther’s skateboard around so pranked him and placed it somewhere else, but I swear I saw Slade take it….+
 ^
Also Kirk farted in front of me while I was in line for ice cream… he is going to pay for that!>

~Today+
 ^
Dear diary,+
 ^
I saw the mayor looking around for her keys again, how did we elect such an idiot mayor? Who loses a key to a mansion?+
 ^
I keep hearing about a weirdo that lives in the lighthouse but I have never seen him. If I did I would beat him up for being a weirdo.+
 ^
I finally got revenge on Kirk for farting on me! He was hanging out with his “buddy” Brad, carrying some papers around.+
 ^
When Brad left I pushed him and stole his papers! Ha-ha! He wrote down his password to his computer, ILoveBrad.+
 ^
What a LOSER! Who puts that as a password? I am sure there’s nothing important on there anyway just a bunch of nerd stuff.>
