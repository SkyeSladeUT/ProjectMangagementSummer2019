~Some long time ago, this island was a distressed area that was taken over by militia from the big island war.+
 ^
Before then this was a peaceful land that was owned by a tribe pack called Mondolians. They were a calm and peaceful people.+
 ^
Then during the War of Isles the island was overthrown by the military. The Mondolians fought back, but ultimately lost.+
 ^
That war was the cause of the extinction of the Mondolians.>
