  itemDescription: Sweeping virus. Seems like it is spreading fast. Carl is deteriorating.
    Doctor seems unsure of being saved, I believe he might be dead by tomorrow morning
    at the rate he is going. Where did this come from? Some sort of sickness? Is there
    an anti-serum or medicine that can help?
